# IWillHelpYou

The group's objective is to alleviate the anguish and loneliness resulting from the sudden change in people's daily lives due to isolation, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, through a digital game that will provide a personalized experience. Upon encountering a character with characteristics that can be personally recognized, the player will experience feelings of empathy and tranquility. Based on this recognition, the game will bring individuals who are in social isolation a way of expressing, as much as recognizing, their feelings in a way that encourages self-care and introspection as responses to the emotional difficulties currently faced due to the pandemic. The moral of the work is to instigate to find encouragement in the company itself.
